AirBnB clone is a team project of two.
This team project is part of the (Alx)Software Engineering program.
It represents the first step towards building a full web application.
The Project will start with console interpreter to perform some operations that include;
create: create a new object from the base object
retrieve: retrieve an object from a file.
do: performs an operation.
destroy: destroy an object.
To start:
Run the following command to start './console.py'
Execution
The shell should work like this in interactive mode:

$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb)
(hbnb)
(hbnb) quit
$
But also in non-interactive mode: (like the Shell project in C)

$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb)
